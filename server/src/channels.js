// Channels: the durable list, and the live voice presence on top of it.
//
// Two halves that are deliberately kept apart:
//
//   Channels    -- durable. Rows in SQLite: name, kind, order, password.
//   VoiceRooms  -- live. Who is connected right now, derived from open
//                  WebSockets and never written to disk.
//
// That split is the README's "liveness is never tracked, only observed" applied
// to voice. A restart loses the presence and rebuilds it from reconnecting
// clients, instead of leaving a stale members table to be reconciled with
// reality -- which is the bug every "who is online" table eventually has.

 * A channel name is kept as it was typed.

 * move: a nickname is an IDENTIFIER. It is what @mentions match, what the
 * MediaMTX username namespace holds, and what one person is and another
 * is not, so two spellings of it would be two people.
 *
 * A channel name is a LABEL. Nothing matches on it, nothing is routed by
 * it -- voice paths are `vc-<cid>-<mid>-<k>` and never contain it -- and
 * the only thing it has to do is read well in a sidebar. Group names have
 * always been kept as typed, which made "Game Night" sit under "Hangouts"
 * as `gamenight`, in the same list, for no reason anybody could see.
 *
 * What is still refused: anything invisible. Control characters, and the
 * format characters too -- a right-to-left override in a sidebar reverses
 * the names around it, which is the same reason a display name and a
 * soundpad label refuse one.
 *
 * The two exceptions are U+200D and U+FE0F, which hold emoji together.
 * \p{C} would be the obvious one-line test and it takes both of those with
 * it, so an emoji in a channel name would silently come apart into its
