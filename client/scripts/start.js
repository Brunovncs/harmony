// It reads like a bug in the app and is a bug in the environment. Plenty of
// tools set it for their own child processes -- VS Code and anything
// embedding Electron among them -- and it is inherited by every terminal
// those tools open, so a developer can hit this without having typed it.

// client/test/cdp.mjs has deleted it since the test harness was written,
// with the same comment. `npm start` had no such protection, which is why
// the tests kept passing while the app would not open.

// Nothing here is Electron-specific beyond the spawn: this file runs under
// plain Node, so `require('electron')` returns the path to the binary
// rather than the module.
