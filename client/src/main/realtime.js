// renderer is served over a custom scheme with `default-src 'self'` and no
// `connect-src`, so it cannot open a socket at all. Main owns the connection
// and forwards frames over IPC.
//
// Node's global WebSocket (Node 22+, and Electron 44 bundles Node 24) means
// this needs no dependency. It is browser-shaped, which has one consequence
// worth stating because it drives the protocol: it cannot set request headers,
// so the session token cannot travel in an Authorization header. It goes in a
// `hello` frame instead and the server accepts nothing else until it arrives.
